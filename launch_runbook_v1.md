# Launch Runbook Documentation

## What is a Runbook?

A runbook is a standardized document that provides detailed procedures for launching and managing software features or systems. Think of it as an operational playbook that ensures consistent, reliable execution of complex technical processes.

## Why We Need Runbooks

### Risk Mitigation
- Prevents critical steps from being missed
- Reduces human error during high-pressure situations
- Ensures compliance and security requirements are met
- Provides clear rollback procedures if issues arise

### Knowledge Management
- Centralizes operational knowledge
- Reduces dependency on specific team members
- Facilitates training of new team members
- Creates a foundation for continuous improvement

### Operational Excellence
- Standardizes launch procedures across teams
- Enables faster incident response
- Improves communication during critical events
- Helps measure and improve process effectiveness
